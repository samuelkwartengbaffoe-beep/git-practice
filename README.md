# Git Practice

This repository is where I explore and practice various Git concepts as I continue improving my version control skills.

## Overview
I recreated this repo to walk through essential Git workflows such as making commits, pushing changes, creating and switching branches, and merging updates. I also practiced resolving an intentional merge conflict to better understand how Git handles conflicting changes. The repository currently contains multiple branches as I continue experimenting and learning.

## What I’ve Practiced So Far
- Creating, switching, and deleting branches  
- Making commits with clear messages  
- Pushing changes to a remote repository  
- Merging branches into the main branch  
- Handling and resolving merge conflicts  

This repo will continue to grow as I learn more Git commands and deepen my understanding.
